description: The complete save chain — from UI click through localStorage and server POST to JSON on disk. Use when save fails, values don't persist, or adding new state fields.

Trace the full save path from button click to persisted JSON.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — what's happening (e.g., "save not working", "field doesn't persist", "adding new save field", "server returns 500")

## Owner

**ExportEngine** (`engine-export.js`) — the ONE save function. No other engine writes to localStorage or POSTs to the server.

## The Save Chain (6 Steps)

### Step A: Sync UI inputs to ConfigEngine.state
`ExportEngine.save()` reads every active UI input and writes values into `ConfigEngine.state`:
- 4 setback inputs: `sb-front`, `sb-rear`, `sb-side-l`, `sb-side-r`
- Active building inputs: `bldgOrientInput`, `bldgW`, `bldgD`, `bldgOffsetX`, `bldgOffsetY`, `bldgCount`, `bldgStackSpacing`, `bldgStackAngle`, `bldgStories`, `bldgFloorHeight`
- Anchor mode: reads which of `anchorFront/Center/Rear` has `.active` class
- Commercial front toggle: `commFrontCheck.checked`
- MapEngine dim state: `showBldgDims`, `hiddenDimKeys`, `chainWOffset`, `chainDOffset`

**Why this step exists:** User may have typed into an input but not pressed Enter. The DOM has the value but ConfigEngine.state doesn't. This sync captures everything.

### Step B: Build payload via `_payload()`
Reads `ConfigEngine.state` and constructs the canonical save object:

```
{
  project: "ProjectBook-Planner",
  siteId: ConfigEngine.data.siteId,
  saved: {
    lat, lng, rotation, locked,
    setbacks: { front, rear, sideL, sideR },
    buildings: [...],
    activeBuilding,
    commFront, showBldgDims,
    hiddenDimKeys: [...],  // Set → Array
    chainWOffset, chainDOffset,
    mapOpacity,
    setbacksApplied,
    freeDrag, snapEdge,
    vehicles: [...],
    activeVehicle
  }
}
```

If a `preapp_*` checklist key exists in localStorage, it's appended as `.checklist`.

**_payload() is the spec.** Every field that must survive reload MUST appear here.

### Step C: Write to localStorage
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('site_state', JSON.stringify(this._payload()))
```
- Synchronous, instant, offline-safe
- Single key `site_state` — not namespaced by site
- On next page load, `ConfigEngine.init()` reads this key first

### Step D: POST to dev server
Only if hostname is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`:
```javascript
fetch('/save', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(payload) })
```
- Server uses `siteId` to find the target JSON file in `data/sites/`
- **Atomic write:** server writes to `.tmp` file, then renames over original
- Preserves `.site` key entirely — only overwrites `.saved`

### Step E: Server rebuilds HTML
After writing JSON, server calls `build()` to recompile both output files.
New `__SITE_DEFAULTS__` global reflects the updated `.saved` data.

### Step F: Flash badge
- Success: green "Saved" badge for 2 seconds
- Failure: red badge with error message for 4 seconds
- localStorage was already written in Step C — no data lost even on server error

## What Is NOT Saved

The `.site` key — all permanent parcel data (address, APN, zoning, FAR, fees). The live save path never touches it. To change `.site`, manually edit the JSON and rebuild.

## What Triggers save()

Every button/action that changes state calls `ExportEngine.save()`:
- Save Setbacks button
- Save Config button
- Save Boundary button
- FAB Save Config button
- Lock/Unlock toggle
- commFrontCheck toggle
- Building drag end
- Vehicle drag end
- Vehicle type/orientation change
- Reset button
- Rotation slider change
- Free drag / snap edge toggles
- Image export, LISP export, download config

## Adding a New Saved Field

1. Add to `_payload()` in engine-export.js (under `.saved`)
2. Add to `ConfigEngine.init()` — read from `SD.saved.newField` with fallback
3. In save() — add UI sync if the field has a DOM input
4. In the consuming engine — read from `ConfigEngine.state.newField`
5. Verify: change → save → reload → check value persists

## Debugging Save Issues

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Value doesn't persist after reload | Is it in `_payload()`? AND in `ConfigEngine.init()` restore? |
| Save flash doesn't appear | Check `#map-save-flash` element exists in DOM |
| Server returns 500 | Check terminal for Python error — usually JSON parse failure |
| Server returns 404 | `siteId` doesn't match any file in `data/sites/` |
| localStorage has value but page shows old data | `ConfigEngine.init()` may prefer `__SITE_DEFAULTS__` over localStorage — check priority |
| Checklist not saving | Check if `preapp_*` key exists in localStorage — checklist append is conditional |
| Save works on localhost but not file:// | POST /save skipped on file:// — only localStorage works |

## Rules

- ExportEngine.save() is the ONLY write path — no exceptions
- _payload() is the ONLY place that decides what gets saved
- .site is NEVER touched by save — manual edit + rebuild only
- Every new .saved field needs BOTH _payload() AND ConfigEngine.init()
- Atomic server write prevents corruption — never write directly to the JSON file
